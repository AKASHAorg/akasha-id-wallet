# akasha-id-lib
DID library for AKASHA.id, comprised of a "wallet" and a client.

## DIDClient

To initialize the client, you will need a list of attributes for the application you are creating, such as the application `name`, a short `description`, an app `image URL`, and finally the `app URL`. You can also pass an optional configuration parameter (as an object).

```JavaScript
const config = {
    hubUrls: ['https://examplehub1.com'],
    walletUrl: 'https://akasha.id/#/wallet/',
    debug: true
}
const appInfo = {
  name: 'AKASHA.world',
  description: 'The super cool AKASHA World app!',
  icon: 'https://app.akasha.world/icon.png',
  url: 'https://app.akasha.world'
}
const client = new DIDclient(appInfo, config)
```

**NOTE:** For convenience during development, you can start a local hub server with `npm run testhub`, which will listen on port `8080`.

The next step is to generate the initial request/login link in the app, and then display it as a button or a link for the users to click. You can also put the link in a QR code.

```JavaScript
const link = await client.registrationLink()
// -> https://akasha.id/#/wallet/WyJhIiwiMDVjZjBjNzZmMGMwZTNmNjUwODVhYTA1YmZmODFkMGI3MmI1M2VmOSIsIkVEZUJLekpwUkoyeVhUVnVncFRTQ2c9PSIsMTY4NzQ2NF0=
```

At the same time, attach an event listener for the response coming from the AKASHA.id app.

```JavaScript
const response = await client.requestProfile()
```

The response object will contain the following attributes, and it should be stored locally (client-side) for future use.

```JavaScript
{
    allowed: true, // or false if the user denyed the request
    claim: { ... }, // an object containing the profile attributes shared by the user
    token: 'e6122c80e7a293901244e5cb87c32546692d5651', // unique ID for this app that is used for future requests
    refreshEncKey: '3gCE799TuL9QN5huAJ+aTg==', // one-time-use encryption key for the next request
}
```

If the app would like to request a fresh copy of the profile data, it can send a `refreshProfile` request.

```JavaScript
// get the channel ID for refresh from the user's DID in the claim above
const channel = response['claim']['credentialSubject']['id'].split(':')[2]

const response = await client.refreshProfile(channel, response.token, response.refreshEncKey)
// console.log(response) returns the same response object as in the previous step
```

## DIDWallet

The wallet handles requests for the user's profile attributes. It accepts a configuration parameter (as an object) that contains the `hubUrls`. The hubs values must be the same as the ones used by the `DIDclient`.

```JavaScript
const config = {
    hubUrls: ['https://examplehub1.com'],
    debug: true
}
const wallet = new DIDwallet(config)
// do not forget to init the listener
await wallet.init()
```

After a the user clicks the login link generated by a "client" app, or when the QR code is scanned, they will be taken to the AKASHA.id app. Once there, the link needs to be parsed in order to get to the relevant request data generated by the 3rd party app (aka the client).

```JavaScript
// Assuming a the link was the following
const link = 'https://akasha.id/#/wallet/WyJhIiwiMDVjZjBjNzZmMGMwZTNmNjUwODVhYTA1YmZmODFkMGI3MmI1M2VmOSIsIkVEZUJLekpwUkoyeVhUVnVncFRTQ2c9PSIsMTY4NzQ2NF0='
const rawRequest = link.substring(27) // to strip https://akasha.id/#/wallet/
// parse the link to get the initial handshake attributes
const request = await wallet.registerApp(rawRequest)
```

The `request` contents will look similar to the object below.

```JavaScript
{
    appInfo: {name: "AKASHA.world", description: "The super cool AKASHA World app!", icon: "https://app.akasha.world/icon.png", url: "https://app.akasha.world"}
    channel: "1ce120a6f8630283db7c434ce74541831b4106a2"
    key: "VCm7C1ci28M+8TFf2LA4PA=="
    nonce: 579482
    token: "4962391a0dbf2abee7e0ea4d07814aa16cc2cefc"
}
```

The AKASHA.id app can now use the `appInfo` data to display a modal/page to the user, informing them about the app that is currently requesting access to the profile elements, as well as displaying a list of available attributes from the profile that can be disclosed to the client app.

```JavaScript
...

// display a modal with data from request.appInfo as well as a list of attributes

...

// collect all the selected attributes in an attributes object
const attributes = { ... }

...

// send the claim
await wallet.sendClaim(request, attributes, true) // 
```

You can also use `false` and `null/empty` attributes obj to deny a request.

```JavaScript
await wallet.sendClaim(request, null, false)
```

To remove a claim created for a specific app, you can use the app token when calling `removeApp()`.

```JavaScript
await wallet.removeApp(token)
```
